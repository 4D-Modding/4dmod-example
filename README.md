# 4DMod Example
 This is a project example for making 4D Miner mods using the [4D-Modding](https://4dmodding.me/ "4D-Modding") framework.
 
 For basic tutorials (like on how to start modding and on how to package the mod) you should check the [4dmodding-tutorials](https://github.com/4D-Modding/4dmodding-tutorials "4dmodding-tutorials") repo.
 More advanced tutorials are going to come later in a video format.

 You can also check out [4D-Fly Source-Code](https://github.com/4D-Modding/4DFly).

 Also if you are going to use this 4DMod Example, use it as a repo template instead of just `git clone`-ing it
